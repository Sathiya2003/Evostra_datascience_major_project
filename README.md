# Evostra_datascience_major_project
For this project, exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be used to analyze loan data in order to determine the factors that affect loan default. Finding patterns using univariate and bivariate analysis is the goal, along with identifying outliers, missing data, and data imbalance. Finding significant correlations in the data will help you distinguish between clients who have payment issues and those who don't. You'll then present your findings using visual aids, offering guidance for improved lending decisions.
